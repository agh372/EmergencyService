# EmergencyService
A user in distress, calls for help using the mobile app, which finds out all possible lists of hospital and its traffic density from the user to the hospital and it calculates which ambulance takes the least amount of time to reach the user, based on that, it sends a notification to the hospital. Also when the ambulance is moving, the signal priority is given to it (the signal turns green when the ambulance is in vicinity to the signal, and others turn red). This way, the ambulance will reach the user as soon as possible. simulator.py class shows the traffic signal simulation  during the emergency.
